# [Mental Health Website Name]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This website was developed in partnership with the University of Waterloo chapter of Engineers Without Borders. It aims to promote positive mental health practices, raise awareness about the topic, and fundraise for mental health research and students who are in need of mental health resources beyond those that are free through the university. 

ReactJS was used to develop the project, based off this [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/TLWrlNI9VpYqEtCfbsoRxa/EWB-Mental-Health-Website?node-id=0%3A1). Stripe was used for the backend to process donation and shop payments.
